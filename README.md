# Stepper-Motor-Angle-Display-on-LCD-Using-PIC-Microcontroller
This project demonstrates how to control a stepper motor and display its rotation angle on an LCD using a PIC microcontroller. The code is written in Embedded C using MPLAB IDE, and the simulation is done in Proteus. It helps in understanding stepper motor control and LCD interfacing with PIC microcontrollers.
# Features
Controls stepper motor rotation.
Displays the current rotation angle on a 16x2 LCD.
Uses precise step control for accurate angle display.
# Tools Used
Microcontroller: PIC, 
Programming Language: Embedded C, 
IDE: MPLAB IDE, 
Simulation Software: Proteus
# How It Works
The stepper motor is driven using a control sequence from the PIC microcontroller.
Each step movement updates the angle value.
The current angle is displayed on the LCD in real time.
