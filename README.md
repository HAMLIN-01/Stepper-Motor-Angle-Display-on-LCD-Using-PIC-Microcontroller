# Stepper-Motor-Angle-Display-on-LCD-Using-PIC-Microcontroller
This project demonstrates how to control a stepper motor and display its rotation angle on an LCD using a PIC microcontroller. The code is written in Embedded C using MPLAB IDE, and the simulation is done in Proteus. It helps in understanding stepper motor control and LCD interfacing with PIC microcontrollers.
